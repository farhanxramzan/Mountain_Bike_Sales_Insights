Total Revenue: A strong $361K, with Total Profit hitting $164K after covering $198K in costs.
Daily Performance: On average, there are 8 daily orders, which indicates consistent interest.
### 🌍 Where are we winning?
Revenue by Country:

The United States leads the pack with $133K in revenue, followed closely by Australia at $112K.
Other regions, such as France, Germany, Canada, and the UK, trail significantly, indicating potential untapped markets.
Top States:

California tops sales and profits with $75K in sales and $34K profit.
New South Wales, Queensland, Oregon, and Washington round out the top-performing regions, but there’s room to elevate profitability here.
### 🚴‍♀️ Product Insights:
Our most profitable products belong to the Mountain-200 series, with the Black 46 variant generating the highest revenue at $32K.
However, diversity in product sales is limited, meaning a potential opportunity exists to explore other models or variants.
### 👫 Understanding Our Customers:
By Gender: Females dominate purchases, contributing 60% of the revenue, while males contribute 40%. Targeted marketing strategies could boost female participation further.
By Age Group:
Adults (35-64) are our largest customer segment, accounting for 53% of orders.
Young Adults (25-34) and Youth (<25) contribute 33% and 14%, respectively. Engaging the younger audience is a clear growth opportunity.
### 📅 When are we making money?
Daily Trends: Sales show a consistent upward trend, peaking at $216K, indicating growing demand over time.
Weekday Insights: Sunday and Wednesday are our strongest sales days, with Sundays pulling in a remarkable $0.11M! On the flip side, Monday through Thursday lag significantly. Weekend promotions or weekday strategies could close the gap.
### 🔍 Key Business Problem:
While our performance in the U.S. and Australia is outstanding, sales in other regions like Canada, Germany, and the UK are underwhelming. Similarly, the dominance of specific product variants and customer demographics highlights a limited audience reach. Expanding product offerings and improving market penetration globally and across diverse customer groups is essential to unlock sustained growth.

Product Expansion: Introduce and promote new bike models to diversify revenue sources.
